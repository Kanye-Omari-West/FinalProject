============
KanyeQuest

  Our group's game is based on Pac-Man. Instead of Pac-Man, however, the player will control Kanye West as he goes through increasingly difficult levels in the PacMan-based game. Chasing Kanye, in place of ghosts seen in Pac-Man, are various enemies and rivals that he has developed throughout his career that will aim to catch or trap Kanye. The player has a set amount of lives and after being caught a certain amount of times, the game will be over. The goal of the game is to "eat" all of the dots on the screen so that you can advance to the next level. In addition to the generic dots that will only give points, there are certain "power-ups" that the player can grab. These items will either help or hinder the player by doing things such as speeding up or slowing down the player's movements. However, all items on the screen must be picked up regardless of their nature in order to finish the level. The starting screen of the game will also include instructions to explain the objective, backstory, and items found in the game.
