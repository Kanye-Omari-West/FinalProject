KanyeQuest

Our game follows Kanye West as he goes on a quest in the form of a "path to greatness." It is based on meta-games, comprised of multiple smaller games, found on websites like Funbrain. The game puts the player as Kanye West who must go across a path in order to successfully reach his ultimate objective,  becoming a god. In order to advance on the path, the player must complete several mini-games; after each mini-game is successfully completed, the player will advance to the next mini-game. The game altogether consists of four mini-games. The games are based on a short poem.
  
Kanye West gets up from his Kanye rest
And gets Kanye dressed in his Kanye vest
He is now ready for his Kanye test
Too bad he Kanye guessed
His ego grows because he's the Kanye Best
He distrurbs a Kanye nest and fights all the Kanye Pests
Now prove that he is the Kanye Best

In the first mini-game, the player must take a test consisting of random Kanye West related trivia. Afterwards, the player must help Kanye get "dressed." This game is very similar to the raindrop game that was made earlier. Kanye West is used as a "catcher" to catch falling articles of clothing such as underwear, sneakers, and vests.  This trivia can range from where he was born to naming other celebrities that he has had altercations with. There are ten questions total and all of them must be answered correctly in order to advance past this Kanye Test. Afterwards, the game advances to a "fly swatter" mini-game. Kanye West must hit all of the Kanye Pests on the screen with his fly swatter. Finally, Kanye's ego needs stroking. Arrowkeys will drop from the screen as the player is required to time their button presses correctly to correspond to each arrowkey. This part of the game is similar to a computer keyboard version of Dance Dance Revolution or Guitar Hero. Prove he is the best by following the arrowkeys on screen. General instructions are provided on the game's start screen. The intro page consists of Kanye West's face with his albums below, as well as his two iconic bear mascots on either side of him. The game over screen, meanwhile, shows Kanye West in the middle of his infamous argument with radio-personality Sway Calloway.
