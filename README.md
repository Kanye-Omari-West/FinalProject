KanyeQuest

  Our game follows Kanye West as he goes on a quest in the form of a "path to greatness." It is based on meta-games, comprised of multiple smaller games, found on websites like Funbrain. The game puts the player as Kanye West who must go across a path in order to successfully reach his ultimate objective,  becoming a god. In order to advance on the path, the player must complete several mini-games; after each mini-game is successfully completed, the player will advance to the next spot on the path. The game altogether consists of four mini-games. Each mini-game is based on one of Kanye West's songs and will have the cooresponding instrumental music in the background. However, at the very end of the game, there is one final surpise that Kanye must overcome to reach greatness. Instructions are supplied on the game's start screen, as well as additional instructions for each mini-game before each game is played.
